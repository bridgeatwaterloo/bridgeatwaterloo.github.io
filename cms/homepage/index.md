<strong>The Bridge at Waterloo – a bridge to a better future,</strong> improving young people's chances of finding employment or creating their own. An initiative, built extensively around the arts, to reduce local youth unemployment, unlock the potential of local people, strengthen local communities and create a remarkable performance space for London.
