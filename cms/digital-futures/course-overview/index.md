arts-and-creativity: <p>The month-long Digital Futures course will see students design and develop an app that allows an audience to control a live theatre performance. Audience members should be able to vote on which scenes to see, and their interactions with the app should affect the lights, sound and projections. </p><p>The sixteen students will collaboratively design and develop the production, including the content of the projections, the soundscapes, and each scene's interaction, from what is displayed in the app, to what happens as a result on the stage.</p>

coding-employability: <p>Every industry and business has been transformed in some way by technology. As a result, all employers are on the look out for people with coding skills.</p> <p>Coding skills are the prerequisite for success in the 21st Century. A comprehensive understanding of technology, combined with the confidence to be creative with technology and work well in a collaborative environment come a close second. All our students will leave with both of these.</p><p>The course will tap into the skills and expertise of the Bridge at Waterloo community to deliver a programme of employability skills.</p>

mentoring-person-centric: <p>Each student will work with a dedicated mentor from the local community.</p><p>Their mentor will provide guidance and support throughout the course.</p><p>Digital Futures will apply a person-centric approach to the learning process. Each day will be highly fluid, with the content of the course being largely dictated by the questions and challenges raised and faced by our students. </p><p>The more musically-minded students might focus on designing soundscapes using Sonic Pi, a programming language for making interactive music, whilst the more graphic design-focused students will work on the design framework of the app using CSS, the coding language used to create the rich interfaces of most apps and all websites. </p>
